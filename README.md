# **JustPong**

A simple recreation of the classic Pong game, built entirely using Swift. This is my first Swift project and also the first game I‚Äôve developed. It was a great learning experience for understanding the fundamentals of game development, including collision detection, UI components, and basic animation.

## üìú Overview

This project is a minimalist version of the classic Pong game. The player controls a paddle to prevent the ball from getting past their side of the screen. The goal is to score points by bouncing the ball past the opponent‚Äôs paddle.

### Features:

	‚Ä¢	Player vs. AI: The game currently allows single-player mode where you play against a basic AI opponent at varying difficulty.
	‚Ä¢	Score Tracking: Simple score system displayed center screen.
	‚Ä¢	Collision Detection: Implemented for ball bouncing mechanics off paddles and walls.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements:

	‚Ä¢	Xcode: Version 16.0
	‚Ä¢	iOS: 15.6 or later

### Running the Project:
1.	Clone the repository:
 
```
   git clone https://github.com/bolgapdf/JustPong/
```
2.	Open the .xcodeproj file in Xcode.
3.	Select your preferred simulator or connected device, then hit the ‚ÄúRun‚Äù button (‚åò + R).

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges and Lessons Learned

### Being my first Swift project, I encountered and overcame a number of challenges:

  * Game Logic: Implementing touch controls and modify ball movement and physics.
  * Collision Detection: Ensuring the ball responds correctly to paddles and screen boundaries.
  * Swift UI Components: Learning to use UIKit/SpriteKit to design game elements.


This project helped solidify my understanding of core Swift concepts and introduced me to game development in iOS.

## ‚ú® Future Improvements
  * Add sound effects for ball-paddle hits and scoring.
  * Vary ball speed based off of user performance.
  * Improve AI behavior for a more challenging experience.
  * Pause, Main Menu, and Restart Game functionality.
